Custom 24-hour TSW5 timetable for the Groningen-Zwolle route</p> <br/> <br/>

Awake24 is a custom-made, fully operational and expanded timetable for the Zwolle-Groningen route in **Train Sim World 5**. Instead of being limited to the usual operating hours, Awake24 extends the standard timetable into a full 24-hour experience and introduces additional features, such as more playable services and extra AI traffic; making the route feel even more alive. Whether you prefer long-distance Intercity runs, late-night commuter services or detailed shunting trips, Awake24 brings greater levels of variety and immersion to your TSW5 gameplay. 

The intentions of the timetable are not to represent a picture-perfect reflection of real-world operations and exact levels of realism. Rather, it prioritizes variety and enjoyment, offering a lively, around-the-clock timetable that provides a fun, diverse and engaging driving experience during any hour of the day. 

<br/> <br/>



### Features
* **True 24-hour timetable** - Services are running literally day and night, not just between 05:00 and 00:00.
* **Improved service coverage** - Additional trains are running around the clock. Groningen-Zwolle now runs with hourly Intercity commuter services  throughout the day, along with continuous 24-hour connections to Assen Platform 2 (no longer limited to rush hour services). 
* **Timetable fixes** - More portal services are running from/to Leeuwarden and around Zwolle. AI-operated Blauwnet services at Zwolle and Arriva services at Groningen are now included.
* **New service additions** - Including the Intercity Direct to Zwolle and Intercity to Meppel (reviving the old Leeuwarden - Meppel service).
* **More Locomotives** - AI Blauwnet and Arriva services are operated with custom-designed 323TTC's, freight trains are occupying the map 24/7. Certain services use a custom-designed BR146 double-decker during peak hours to relieve the absence of the NS VIRM trains


* Fixes from the original timetable, such as a 24 hour commuter service between Groningen - Zwolle using the ICM3, and a 24 hour service between Groningen and Assen (not just rush hour)
* Additional services such as the Intercity Direct to Zwolle, new virtual destinations, 
* More AI services around Zwolle and freight trains, making the rail feel more alive.
* Lots of shunting-related services
* New scenario's and tutorials
* (Potential) - Fixing the empty eastern side of Groningen station with AI services
