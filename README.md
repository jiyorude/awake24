Custom 24-hour TSW5 timetable for the Groningen-Zwolle route</p> <br/> <br/>

Awake24 is a custom-made, fully operational and expanded timetable for the Groningen-Zwolle route in **Train Sim World 5**. It introduces several gameplay- and quality of life improvements to the game, such as additional playable services, extra AI traffic, freight trains and a full 24-hour around the clock driving experience; making the route feel even more alive.

No matter if you prefer long-distance Intercity runs, freight train trips or detailed shunting runs, Awake24 brings greater levels of variety and immersion to your TSW5 gameplay. Please note that the timetable is not intended to represent a perfect reflection of real-word operations and exact levels of realism. Instead, it prioritizes offering variety and enjoyment to the user through a lively, day-round timetable that provides a diverse and engaging experience at any hour of the day.

<br/> <br/>


### Features
* **True 24-hour timetable** 
    * Passenger, shunting and freight services are occupying the map day and night, not just between the traditional hours of 5AM and 12AM;
* **Timetable Fixes**
    * Additional portal services are running from/to Leeuwarden and around Zwolle; 
    * Continuous 24-hour connections to Assen Platform 2 (instead of only rush-hour services); 
    * Higher levels of traffic;
    * All day commuter Intercity services between Groningen and Zwolle with the ICM-3 (instead of only two services at 5AM and 11PM);
    * AI Blauwnet services are now in operation around Zwolle. Services are conducted by custom-designed 323TTC's with NS liveries;
    * Certain peak-hour Intercity services provide the user the freedom to choose between NS ICM-3 or custom-designed DB BR146 + 765/775/785 DBpbzfa double-deckers with NS liveries to somewhat relieve the absence of NS *VIRM* and *DDZ* double-decker trains;
    * The eastern-side of Groningen is occupied with AI Arriva services heading towards Roodeschool/Eemshaven, Delfzijl and Leeuwarden: consisting of custom-designed Class 66 diesel locomotives and DBpbzfa 775 coaches with Arriva liveries;
    * Many more shunting, coupling and uncoupling objectives;
* **New Tutorials and Scenarios**
    * Exciting new ways to familiarize yourself with the timetable or to test your train driving skills!
* **New service additions**
    * Such as the Intercity Groningen - Meppel (revival of the old Leeuwarden - Meppel service) and the Intercity Direct service to Zwolle;
    * Drivable Arriva service between Groningen and Veendam/Leer (Germany) from the western side of the station (from/to Groningen Europapark Platforms 1 and 2);
    * Overhaul of virtual destinations at Groningen and Zwolle;
